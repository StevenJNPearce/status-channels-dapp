# Find All The Conversations!

Navigating the decentralized web can be hard at first. There are anonymous names to deal with, public chats (a.k.a the "radio" of the distributed web), group chats (private to the participants included) and private 1-1 chats.

Plus, there's all the Status channels for different work that is happening, swarms that are currently running, community and communication initiatives and a whole bunch of other stuff.

Also, each DApp that you can access from Status has its own, unique whisper topic - formed simply by #<DApps_name>.

How to keep abreast of all this!?

This is a simple, prettified list, made as the world's most straightforward DApp, that lives in Status and helps you find your way to the most interesting/active parts of the decentralised web. This means we can update the list constantly without needing to update the application itself, and everyone can get to where they need to be as easily as possible.
